# Hello there, I'm Kevin!

I'm a senior undergraduate student at Queens College.

I aim to consistently build upon my skills and sink into the ocean that is Computer Science.
My prior background is an Electrical Engineering degree where I gain experience working in
semiconductor manufacturing. I enjoy tasty foods and always try to eat at a new resturant in NYC.
